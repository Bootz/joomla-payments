Registering your new account
We recommend that you perform your integration and/or functional tests in  test environment
before going live in the production environment. Test environment works almost identically to 
production environment, except that we do not send the transactions to the card acquirer or invoice
you.
Our test environment allows you to make test payments, change your account configuration and
fine-tune the integration of our payment system into your website.
IMPORTANT: When we publish a new release, it is available in our test environment for a couple of
weeks, before we move the release into production. In this way you are able to test possible
changes in our platform. It also means that when there has been a new release, the test and
production versions of our platform differ until the release has been moved to the production
environment.
