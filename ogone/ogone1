Configuring your test account
When you first log into your account, you will see a list of steps to complete on the homepage. These
steps concern the administration, payment method and technical details of your test account.
You can start the configuration by clicking the first link. Once all the steps have been completed, you
can ask for your test account to be activated.
If your account has been activated and you would like to change some details, you can still call up
the various configuration pages from your back-office menu. This is especially useful with regard to
the “Technical Information” page, as you may want to change certain details while testing your
integration
